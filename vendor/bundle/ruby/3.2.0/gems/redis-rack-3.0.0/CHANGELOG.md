    The latest version of Rack [deprecated subclassing Rack::Session::ID](https://github.com/rack/rack/blob/master/lib/rack/session/abstract/id.rb#L412-L419),
    replacing it instead with `Rack::Session::Persisted`. Update the method
    implementations in this gem to support the new API. Shoutouts to @onk
    for actually writing this code, we're pulling it in from his fork.

*   Raise Error when `:redis_store` is Incorrect Type

    Passing an object that isn't a `Redis::Store` into the session storage
    configuration can cause errors when methods are called with more
    arguments than the default Redis client can handle. These additional
    arguments are used by `Rack::Session::Redis` to configure the key
    namespace and TTL globally in the main configuration, and pass them down
    to `Redis::Store` to be appended to the key. An `ArgumentError` will now
    be thrown when a `:redis_store` is of a type that isn't a `Redis::Store`
    (or a subclass thereof).

v2.0.4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*   Release 2.0.4
    Tom Scott

*   Remove .ruby-version
    Tom Scott

*   Remove rake, appraisal from gemspec executables

    The contents of the bin directory are binstubs to assist development.
    They are not intended to be shipped with the gem itself. This commit
    updates the gemspec to ensure that they are not exposed to rubygems as
    executables for redis-rack, which will fix conflicts with the legitimate
    rake and appraisal executables provided by those other gems.

*   v2.0.3: Avoid mutex locking with global option
    Tom Scott

*   Restore default_options in #generate_unique_sid
    Tom Scott

*   Refactor connection_pool code

    Adds a `Redis::Rack::Connection` object for handling the instantiation
    of a `Redis::Store` or a `ConnectionPool` if pool configuration is
    given. Restores the purpose of `Rack::Session::Redis` to only implement
    the session ID abstract API provided by Rack.
