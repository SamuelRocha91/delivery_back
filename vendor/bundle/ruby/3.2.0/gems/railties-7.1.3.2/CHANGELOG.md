## Rails 7.1.3 (January 16, 2024) ##

*   Make sure `config.after_routes_loaded` hook runs on boot.

    *Rafael Mendonça França*

*   Fix `config.log_level` not being respected when using a `BroadcastLogger`

    *Édouard Chin*

*   Fix isolated engines to take `ActiveRecord::Base.table_name_prefix` into consideration.
    This will allow for engine defined models, such as inside Active Storage, to respect
    Active Record table name prefix configuration.

    *Chedli Bourguiba*

*   The `bin/rails app:template` command will no longer add potentially unwanted
    gem platforms via `bundle lock --add-platform=...` commands.

    *Jonathan Hefner*


## Rails 7.1.2 (November 10, 2023) ##

*   Fix running `db:system:change` when app has no Dockerfile.

    *Hartley McGuire*

*   If you accessed `config.eager_load_paths` and friends, later changes to
    `config.paths` were not reflected in the expected auto/eager load paths.
    Now, they are.

    This bug has been latent since Rails 3.

    Fixes #49629.

    *Xavier Noria*

## Rails 7.1.1 (October 11, 2023) ##

*   Ensures the Rails generated Dockerfile uses correct ruby version and matches Gemfile.

    *Abhay Nikam*


## Rails 7.1.0 (October 05, 2023) ##

*   No changes.


## Rails 7.1.0.rc2 (October 01, 2023) ##

*   Always set the Rails logger to be an instance of `ActiveSupport::BroadcastLogger`.

    *Edouard Chin*


## Rails 7.1.0.rc1 (September 27, 2023) ##

*   Require `concurrent-ruby` in `config/puma.rb` so that Puma can boot in
    production when `WEB_CONCURRENCY` is not explicitly specified.

    Fixes #49323.

    *Matt Brictson*

*   Raise error when generating attribute with dangerous name.

    The following will now raise an error as `save` and `hash` are already
    defined by Active Record.

    ```bash
    $ bin/rails generate model Post save
    $ bin/rails generate model Post hash
    ```

    *Petrik de Heus*


## Rails 7.1.0.beta1 (September 13, 2023) ##

*   Add ability to show slow tests to the test runner

    ```bash
    $ bin/test --profile # additionally prints 10 (default) slowest tests
    # or
    $ bin/test --profile 20 # prints 20 slowest tests
    ```

    *fatkodima*

*   `rails new --javascript` generator now supports Bun

    ```bash
    $ rails new my_new_app --javascript=bun
    ```

    *Jason Meller*

*   bin/setup uses `bun` instead of `yarn` when generated an app with bun

    Use `bun install` on `bin/setup` when using `bun`.

    *Cadu Ribeiro*

*   `config/application.rb` now includes

    ```ruby
    config.autoload_lib(ignore: %w(assets tasks))
    ```

    In practice, this means that new 7.1 applications autoload from `lib` out of the box.

    *Xavier Noria*

*   Add an option to start rails console in sandbox mode by default

    `sandbox_by_default` option is added to start rails console in sandbox
    mode by default. With this option turned on, `--no-sandbox` must be
    specified to start rails in non-sandbox mode.

    Note that this option is ignored when rails environment is development
    or test.

    *Shouichi Kamiya*

*   Omit `webdrivers` gem dependency from `Gemfile` template

    *Sean Doyle*

*   Support filtering tests by line ranges

    The new syntax allows you to filter tests by line ranges. For example, the
    following command runs tests from line 10 to 20.

    ```bash
    $ rails test test/models/user_test.rb:10-20
    ```

    *Shouichi Kamiya*, *Seonggi Yang*, *oljfte*, *Ryohei UEDA*

*   Update default scaffold templates to set 303 (See Other) as status code
    on redirect for the update action for XHR requests other than GET or POST
    to avoid issues (e.g browsers trying to follow the redirect using the
    original request method resulting in double PATCH/PUT)

    *Guillermo Iguaran*

*   The new `config.autoload_lib_once` is similar to `config.autoload_lib`,
    except that it adds `lib` to `config.autoload_once_paths` instead.

    By calling `config.autoload_lib_once`, classes and modules in `lib` can be
    autoloaded, even from application initializers, but won't be reloaded.

    Please, see further details in the [autoloading
    guide](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/v7.1/autoloading_and_reloading_constants.html).

    *Xavier Noria*

*   Add `config.action_dispatch.debug_exception_log_level` to configure the log
    level used by `ActionDispatch::DebugExceptions`.

    The default is `:fatal`, but with `load_defaults "7.1"` the default will be
    `:error`.

    *Hartley McGuire*

*   Add `DATABASE` option to `railties:install:migrations`

    This allows you to specify which database the migrations should be copied to
    when running `rails railties:install:migrations`.

    ```bash
    $ rails railties:install:migrations DATABASE=animals
    ```

    *Matthew Hirst*

*   The new method `config.autoload_lib(ignore:)` provides a simple way to
    autoload from `lib`:

    ```ruby
    # config/application.rb
    config.autoload_lib(ignore: %w(assets tasks))
    ```

    Please, see further details in the [autoloading
    guide](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/v7.1/autoloading_and_reloading_constants.html).

    *Xavier Noria*

*   Don't show secret_key_base for `Rails.application.config#inspect`.

    Before:

    ```ruby
    Rails.application.config.inspect
    "#<Rails::Application::Configuration:0x00000001132b02a0 @root=... @secret_key_base=\"b3c631c314c0bbca50c1b2843150fe33\" ... >"
    ```

    After:

    ```ruby
    Rails.application.config.inspect
    "#<Rails::Application::Configuration:0x00000001132b02a0>"
    ```

    *Petrik de Heus*

*   Deprecate calling `Rails.application.secrets`.

    Rails `secrets` have been deprecated in favor of `credentials`.
    Calling `Rails.application.secrets` should show a deprecation warning.

    *Petrik de Heus*

*   Store `secret_key_base` in `Rails.config` for local environments.

    Rails `secrets` have been deprecated in favor of `credentials`.
    For the local environments the `secret_key_base` is now stored in
    `Rails.config.secret_key_base` instead of the soft deprecated
    `Rails.application.secrets.secret_key_base`.

    *Petrik de Heus*

*   Enable force_ssl=true in production by default: Force all access to the app over SSL,
    use Strict-Transport-Security, and use secure cookies

    *Justin Searls*, *Aaron Patterson*, *Guillermo Iguaran*, *Vinícius Bispo*

*   Add engine's draw paths to application route set, so that the application
    can draw route files defined in engine paths.

    *Gannon McGibbon*

*   Support `VISUAL` environment variable for commands which open an editor,
    and prefer it over `EDITOR`.

    *Summer ☀️*

*   Add engine's `test/fixtures` path to `fixture_paths` in `on_load` hook if
    path exists and is under the Rails application root.

    *Chris Salzberg*

*   `bin/rails app:template` now runs `bundle install` and any `after_bundle`
    blocks after the template is executed.

    *Jonathan Hefner* and *Gerry Caulfield*

*   Enable passing column size to migration generator

    Previously you could pass a limit to the migration generator:

    `rails generate migration CreateAuthor name:text{65535}`

    Now, a size attribute can be passed to the migration generator:

    `rails generate migration CreateAuthor name:text{medium}`

    This generates a migration which includes the size attribute:

    ```ruby
    class CreateAuthor < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]
      def change
        create_table :authors do |t|
          t.text :name, size: :medium
        end
      end
    end
    ```

    *Josh Broughton*, *Hartley McGuire*

*   Trying to set a config key with the same name of a method now raises:

    ```ruby
    config.load_defaults = 7.0
    # NoMethodError: Cannot assign to `load_defaults`, it is a configuration method
    ```

    *Xavier Noria*

*   Deprecate `secrets:edit/show` and remove `secrets:setup`

    `bin/rails secrets:setup` has been deprecated since Rails 5.2 in favor of
    credentials. This command has been removed.

    `bin/rails secrets:show` and `bin/rails secrets:edit` have been deprecated
    in favor of credentials.

    Run `bin/rails credentials:help` for more information

    *Petrik de Heus*

*   `bin/rails --help` will now list only framework and plugin commands. Rake
    tasks defined in `lib/tasks/*.rake` files will no longer be included. For a
    list of those tasks, use `rake -T`.

    *Jonathan Hefner*

*   Allow calling `bin/rails restart` outside of app directory.

    The following would previously fail with a "No Rakefile found" error.

    ```bash
    $ blog/bin/rails restart
    ```

    *Petrik de Heus*

*   Support prerelease rubies in Gemfile template if RubyGems version is 3.3.13 or higher.

    *Yasuo Honda*, *David Rodríguez*

*   Autoloading setup honors root directories manually set by the user.

    This is relevant for custom namespaces. For example, if you'd like classes
    and modules under `app/services` to be defined in the `Services` namespace
    without an extra `app/services/services` directory, this is now enough:

    ```ruby
    # config/initializers/autoloading.rb

    # The namespace has to exist.
    #
    # In this example we define the module on the spot. Could also be created
    # elsewhere and its definition loaded here with an ordinary `require`. In
    # any case, `push_dir` expects a class or module object.
    module Services; end

    Rails.autoloaders.main.push_dir("#{Rails.root}/app/services", namespace: Services)
    ```

    Check the autoloading guide for further details.

    *Xavier Noria*

*   Railties now requires the irb gem as a dependency, which means when you install Rails, irb will also
    be installed as a gem. Rails will then use the installed version of irb for its console instead of
    relying on Ruby's built-in version.
    This ensures that Rails has access to the most up-to-date and reliable version of irb for its console.

    *Stan Lo*

*   Use infinitive form for all rails command descriptions verbs.

    *Petrik de Heus*

*   Credentials commands (e.g. `bin/rails credentials:edit`) now respect
    `config.credentials.content_path` and `config.credentials.key_path` when set
    in `config/application.rb` or `config/environments/#{Rails.env}.rb`.

    Before:

      * `bin/rails credentials:edit` ignored `RAILS_ENV`, and would always edit
        `config/credentials.yml.enc`.

      * `bin/rails credentials:edit --environment foo` would create and edit
        `config/credentials/foo.yml.enc`.

      * If `config.credentials.content_path` or `config.credentials.key_path`
        was set, `bin/rails credentials:edit` could not be used to edit the
        credentials.  Editing credentials required using `bin/rails
        encrypted:edit path/to/credentials --key path/to/key`.

    After:

      * `bin/rails credentials:edit` will edit the credentials file that the app
        would load for the current `RAILS_ENV`.

      * `bin/rails credentials:edit` respects `config.credentials.content_path`
        and `config.credentials.key_path` when set in `config/application.rb`
        or `config/environments/#{Rails.env}.rb`.

      * `bin/rails credentials:edit --environment foo` will create and edit
        `config/credentials/foo.yml.enc` _if_ `config.credentials.content_path`
        has not been set for the `foo` environment.  Ultimately, it will edit
        the credentials file that the app would load for the `foo` environment.

    *Jonathan Hefner*

*   Add descriptions for non-Rake commands when running `rails -h`.

    *Petrik de Heus*

*   Show relevant commands when calling help

    When running `rails -h` or just `rails` outside a Rails application,
    Rails outputs all options for running the `rails new` command. This can be
    confusing to users when they probably want to see the common Rails commands.

    Instead, we should always show the common commands when running `rails -h`
    inside or outside a Rails application.

    As the relevant commands inside a Rails application differ from the
    commands outside an application, the help USAGE file has been split to
    show the most relevant commands for the context.

    *Petrik de Heus*

*   Add Rails::HealthController#show and map it to /up for newly generated applications.
    Load balancers and uptime monitors all need a basic endpoint to tell whether the app is up.
    This is a good starting point that'll work in many situations.

    *DHH*

*   Only use HostAuthorization middleware if `config.hosts` is not empty

    *Hartley McGuire*

*   Raise an exception when a `before_action`'s "only" or "except" filter
    options reference an action that doesn't exist. This will be enabled by
    default but can be overridden via config.

    ```ruby
    # config/environments/production.rb
    config.action_controller.raise_on_missing_callback_actions = false
    ```

    *Jess Bees*

*   Use physical processor count as the default Puma worker count in production.
    This can be overridden by setting `ENV["WEB_CONCURRENCY"]` or editing the
    generated "config/puma.rb" directly.

    *DHH*

*   Add Docker files by default to new apps: Dockerfile, .dockerignore, bin/docker-entrypoint.
    These files can be skipped with `--skip-docker`. They're intended as a starting point for
    a production deploy of the application. Not intended for development (see Docked Rails for that).

    Example:

    ```bash
    $ docker build -t app .
    $ docker volume create app-storage
    $ docker run --rm -it -v app-storage:/rails/storage -p 3000:3000 --env RAILS_MASTER_KEY=<see config/master.key> app
    ```

    You can also start a console or a runner from this image:

    ```bash
    $ docker run --rm -it -v app-storage:/rails/storage --env RAILS_MASTER_KEY=<see config/master.key> app console
    ```

    To create a multi-platform image on Apple Silicon to deploy on AMD or Intel and push to Docker Hub for user/app:

    ```bash
    $ docker login -u <user>
    $ docker buildx create --use
    $ docker buildx build --push --platform=linux/amd64,linux/arm64 -t <user/image> .
    ```

    *DHH, Sam Ruby*

*   Add ENV["SECRET_KEY_BASE_DUMMY"] for starting production environment with a generated secret base key,
    which can be used to run tasks like `assets:precompile` without making the RAILS_MASTER_KEY available
    to the build process.

    Dockerfile layer example:

    ```
    RUN SECRET_KEY_BASE_DUMMY=1 bundle exec rails assets:precompile
    ```

    *DHH*

*   Show descriptions for all commands in Rails help

    When calling `rails help` most commands missed their description. We now
    show the same descriptions as shown in `rails -T`.

    *Petrik de Heus*

*   Always generate the storage/ directory with rails new to ensure there's a stable place to
    put permanent files, and a single mount point for containers to map. Then default sqlite3 databases
    to live there instead of db/, which is only meant for configuration, not data.

    *DHH*

*   Rails console now disables `IRB`'s autocompletion feature in production by default.

    Setting `IRB_USE_AUTOCOMPLETE=true` can override this default.

    *Stan Lo*

*   Add `config.precompile_filter_parameters`, which enables precompilation of
    `config.filter_parameters` using `ActiveSupport::ParameterFilter.precompile_filters`.
    Precompilation can improve filtering performance, depending on the quantity
    and types of filters.

    `config.precompile_filter_parameters` defaults to `true` for
    `config.load_defaults 7.1` and above.

    *Jonathan Hefner*

*   Add `after_routes_loaded` hook to `Rails::Railtie::Configuration` for
    engines to add a hook to be called after application routes have been
    loaded.

    ```ruby
    MyEngine.config.after_routes_loaded do
      # code that must happen after routes have been loaded
    end
    ```

    *Chris Salzberg*

*   Send 303 See Other status code back for the destroy action on newly generated
    scaffold controllers.

    *Tony Drake*

*   Add `Rails.application.deprecators` as a central point to manage deprecators
    for an application.

    Individual deprecators can be added and retrieved from the collection:

    ```ruby
    Rails.application.deprecators[:my_gem] = ActiveSupport::Deprecation.new("2.0", "MyGem")
    Rails.application.deprecators[:other_gem] = ActiveSupport::Deprecation.new("3.0", "OtherGem")
    ```

    And the collection's configuration methods affect all deprecators in the
    collection:

    ```ruby
    Rails.application.deprecators.debug = true

    Rails.application.deprecators[:my_gem].debug
    # => true
    Rails.application.deprecators[:other_gem].debug
    # => true
    ```

    Additionally, all deprecators in the collection can be silenced for the
    duration of a given block:

    ```ruby
    Rails.application.deprecators.silence do
      Rails.application.deprecators[:my_gem].warn    # => silenced (no warning)
      Rails.application.deprecators[:other_gem].warn # => silenced (no warning)
    end
    ```

    *Jonathan Hefner*

*   Move dbconsole logic to Active Record connection adapter.

    Instead of hosting the connection logic in the command object, the
    database adapter should be responsible for connecting to a console session.
    This patch moves #find_cmd_and_exec to the adapter and exposes a new API to
    lookup the adapter class without instantiating it.

    *Gannon McGibbon*, *Paarth Madan*

*   Add `Rails.application.message_verifiers` as a central point to configure
    and create message verifiers for an application.

    This allows applications to, for example, rotate old `secret_key_base`
    values:

    ```ruby
    config.before_initialize do |app|
      app.message_verifiers.rotate(secret_key_base: "old secret_key_base")
    end
    ```

    And for libraries to create preconfigured message verifiers:

    ```ruby
    ActiveStorage.verifier = Rails.application.message_verifiers["ActiveStorage"]
    ```

    *Jonathan Hefner*

*   Support MySQL's ssl-mode option for the dbconsole command.

    Verifying the identity of the database server requires setting the ssl-mode
    option to VERIFY_CA or VERIFY_IDENTITY. This option was previously ignored
    for the dbconsole command.

    *Petrik de Heus*

*   Delegate application record generator description to orm hooked generator.

    *Gannon McGibbon*

*   Show BCC recipients when present in Action Mailer previews.

    *Akshay Birajdar*

*   Extend `routes --grep` to also filter routes by matching against path.

    Example:

    ```bash
    $ bin/rails routes --grep /cats/1
    Prefix Verb   URI Pattern         Controller#Action
       cat GET    /cats/:id(.:format) cats#show
           PATCH  /cats/:id(.:format) cats#update
           PUT    /cats/:id(.:format) cats#update
           DELETE /cats/:id(.:format) cats#destroy
    ```

    *Orhan Toy*

*   Improve `rails runner` output when given a file path that doesn't exist.

    *Tekin Suleyman*

*   `config.allow_concurrency = false` now use a `Monitor` instead of a `Mutex`

    This allows to enable `config.active_support.executor_around_test_case` even
    when `config.allow_concurrency` is disabled.

    *Jean Boussier*

*   Add `routes --unused` option to detect extraneous routes.

    Example:

    ```bash
    $ bin/rails routes --unused

    Found 2 unused routes:

    Prefix Verb URI Pattern    Controller#Action
       one GET  /one(.:format) action#one
       two GET  /two(.:format) action#two
    ```

    *Gannon McGibbon*

*   Add `--parent` option to controller generator to specify parent class of job.

    Example:

    `bin/rails g controller admin/users --parent=admin_controller` generates:

    ```ruby
    class Admin::UsersController < AdminController
      # ...
    end
    ```

    *Gannon McGibbon*

*   In-app custom credentials templates are now supported.  When a credentials
    file does not exist, `rails credentials:edit` will now try to use
    `lib/templates/rails/credentials/credentials.yml.tt` to generate the
    credentials file, before falling back to the default template.

    This allows e.g. an open-source Rails app (which would not include encrypted
    credentials files in its repo) to include a credentials template, so that
    users who install the app will get a custom pre-filled credentials file when
    they run `rails credentials:edit`.

    *Jonathan Hefner*

*   Except for `dev` and `test` environments, newly generated per-environment
    credentials files (e.g. `config/credentials/production.yml.enc`) now include
    a `secret_key_base` for convenience, just as `config/credentials.yml.enc`
    does.

    *Jonathan Hefner*

*   `--no-*` options now work with the app generator's `--minimal` option, and
    are both comprehensive and precise.  For example:

    ```bash
    $ rails new my_cool_app --minimal
    Based on the specified options, the following options will also be activated:

      --skip-active-job [due to --minimal]
      --skip-action-mailer [due to --skip-active-job, --minimal]
      --skip-active-storage [due to --skip-active-job, --minimal]
      --skip-action-mailbox [due to --skip-active-storage, --minimal]
      --skip-action-text [due to --skip-active-storage, --minimal]
      --skip-javascript [due to --minimal]
      --skip-hotwire [due to --skip-javascript, --minimal]
      --skip-action-cable [due to --minimal]
      --skip-bootsnap [due to --minimal]
      --skip-dev-gems [due to --minimal]
      --skip-system-test [due to --minimal]

    ...

    $ rails new my_cool_app --minimal --no-skip-active-storage
    Based on the specified options, the following options will also be activated:

      --skip-action-mailer [due to --minimal]
      --skip-action-mailbox [due to --minimal]
      --skip-action-text [due to --minimal]
      --skip-javascript [due to --minimal]
      --skip-hotwire [due to --skip-javascript, --minimal]
      --skip-action-cable [due to --minimal]
      --skip-bootsnap [due to --minimal]
      --skip-dev-gems [due to --minimal]
      --skip-system-test [due to --minimal]

    ...
    ```

    *Brad Trick* and *Jonathan Hefner*

*   Add `--skip-dev-gems` option to app generator to skip adding development
    gems (like `web-console`) to the Gemfile.

    *Brad Trick*

*   Skip Active Storage and Action Mailer if Active Job is skipped.

    *Étienne Barrié*

*   Correctly check if frameworks are disabled when running app:update.

    *Étienne Barrié* and *Paulo Barros*

*   Delegate model generator description to orm hooked generator.

    *Gannon McGibbon*

*   Execute `rails runner` scripts inside the executor.

    Enables error reporting, query cache, etc.

    *Jean Boussier*

*   Avoid booting in development then test for test tasks.

    Running one of the rails test subtasks (e.g. test:system, test:models) would
    go through Rake and cause the app to be booted twice. Now all the test:*
    subtasks are defined as Thor tasks and directly load the test environment.

    *Étienne Barrié*

*   Deprecate `Rails::Generators::Testing::Behaviour` in favor of `Rails::Generators::Testing::Behavior`.

    *Gannon McGibbon*

*   Allow configuration of logger size for local and test environments

    `config.log_file_size`

    Defaults to `100` megabytes.

    *Bernie Chiu*

*   Enroll new apps in decrypted diffs of credentials by default.  This behavior
    can be opted out of with the app generator's `--skip-decrypted-diffs` flag.

    *Jonathan Hefner*

*   Support declarative-style test name filters with `bin/rails test`.

    This makes it possible to run a declarative-style test such as:

    ```ruby
    class MyTest < ActiveSupport::TestCase
      test "does something" do
        # ...
      end
    end
    ```

    Using its declared name:

    ```bash
    $ bin/rails test test/my_test.rb -n "does something"
    ```

    Instead of having to specify its expanded method name:

    ```bash
    $ bin/rails test test/my_test.rb -n test_does_something
    ```

    *Jonathan Hefner*

*   Add `--js` and `--skip-javascript` options to `rails new`

    `--js` alias to `rails new --javascript ...`

    Same as `-j`, e.g. `rails new --js esbuild ...`

    `--skip-js` alias to `rails new --skip-javascript ...`

    Same as `-J`, e.g. `rails new --skip-js ...`

    *Dorian Marié*

*   Allow relative paths with leading dot slash to be passed to `rails test`.

    Fix `rails test ./test/model/post_test.rb` to run a single test file.

    *Shouichi Kamiya* and *oljfte*

*   Deprecate `config.enable_dependency_loading`. This flag addressed a limitation of the `classic` autoloader and has no effect nowadays. To fix this deprecation, please just delete the reference.

    *Xavier Noria*

*   Define `config.enable_reloading` to be `!config.cache_classes` for a more intuitive name. While `config.enable_reloading` and `config.reloading_enabled?` are preferred from now on, `config.cache_classes` is supported for backwards compatibility.

    *Xavier Noria*

*   Add JavaScript dependencies installation on bin/setup

    Add  `yarn install` to bin/setup when using esbuild, webpack, or rollout.

    *Carlos Ribeiro*

*   Use `controller_class_path` in `Rails::Generators::NamedBase#route_url`

    The `route_url` method now returns the correct path when generating
    a namespaced controller with a top-level model using `--model-name`.

    Previously, when running this command:

    ```bash
    $ bin/rails generate scaffold_controller Admin/Post --model-name Post
    ```

    the comments above the controller action would look like:

    ``` ruby
    # GET /posts
    def index
      @posts = Post.all
    end
    ```

    afterwards, they now look like this:

    ``` ruby
    # GET /admin/posts
    def index
      @posts = Post.all
    end
    ```

    Fixes #44662.

    *Andrew White*

*   No longer add autoloaded paths to `$LOAD_PATH`.

    This means it won't be possible to load them with a manual `require` call, the class or module can be referenced instead.

    Reducing the size of `$LOAD_PATH` speed-up `require` calls for apps not using `bootsnap`, and reduce the
    size of the `bootsnap` cache for the others.

    *Jean Boussier*

*   Remove default `X-Download-Options` header

    This header is currently only used by Internet Explorer which
    will be discontinued in 2022 and since Rails 7 does not fully
    support Internet Explorer this header should not be a default one.

    *Harun Sabljaković*

*   Add .node-version files for Rails apps that use Node.js

    Node version managers that make use of this file:
      https://github.com/shadowspawn/node-version-usage#node-version-file-usage

    The generated Dockerfile will use the same node version.
