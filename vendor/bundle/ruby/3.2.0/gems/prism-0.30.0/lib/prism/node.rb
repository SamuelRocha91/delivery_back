    # Sometimes you want to check an instance of a node against a list of

    # case statement and doing `case node; when cls1; when cls2; end`. Both of

    # method calls, and/or array allocations.

    # Instead, you can call #type, which will return to you a symbol that you
    # can use for comparison. This is faster than the other approaches because
    # it uses a single integer comparison, but also because if you're on CRuby
