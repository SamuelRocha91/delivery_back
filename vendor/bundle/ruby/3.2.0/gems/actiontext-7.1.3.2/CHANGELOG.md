*   Use `Rails::HTML5::SafeListSanitizer` by default in the Rails 7.1 configuration if it is
    supported.

    Action Text's sanitizer can be configured by setting
    `config.action_text.sanitizer_vendor`. Supported values are `Rails::HTML4::Sanitizer` or
    `Rails::HTML5::Sanitizer`.

    The Rails 7.1 configuration will set this to `Rails::HTML5::Sanitizer` when it is supported, and
    fall back to `Rails::HTML4::Sanitizer`. Previous configurations default to
    `Rails::HTML4::Sanitizer`.

    As a result of this change, the defaults for `ActionText::ContentHelper.allowed_tags` and
    `.allowed_attributes` are applied at runtime, so the value of these attributes is now 'nil'
    unless set by the application. You may call `sanitizer_allowed_tags` or
    `sanitizer_allowed_attributes` to inspect the tags and attributes being allowed by the
    sanitizer.

*   Attachables now can override default attachment missing template.

    When rendering Action Text attachments where the underlying attachable model has
    been removed, a fallback template is used. You now can override this template on
    a per-model basis. For example, you could render a placeholder image for a file
    attachment or the text "Deleted User" for a User attachment.

    *Ka√≠que Kandy Koga*

*   Action Text attachment URLs rendered in a background job (a la Turbo
    Streams) now use `Rails.application.default_url_options` and
    `Rails.application.config.force_ssl` instead of `http://example.org`.

    *Jonathan Hefner*

*   Support `strict_loading:` option for `has_rich_text` declaration

    *Sean Doyle*

*   Update ContentAttachment so that it can encapsulate arbitrary HTML content in a document.

    *Jamis Buck*

*   Fix an issue that caused the content layout to render multiple times when a
    rich_text field was updated.

    *Jacob Herrington*
